## Recommended Learning Path

**Week 1-2**: Projects 1-5 (Focus on fundamentals)
**Week 3-4**: Projects 6-10 (Build complexity)
**Week 5**: Projects 11-15 (Solidify intermediate concepts)
**Week 6-7**: Pick 2-3 from Projects 16-25 (Showcase advanced skills)
**Week 8**: Project 26 or 27 (Architecture showcase)

## Portfolio Strategy

Instead of building all 30, strategically choose **5-7 projects** that demonstrate:

1. **Performance optimization** (Virtual scrolling, lazy loading)
2. **Complex state management** (Kanban board, Form builder)
3. **Real-time features** (Chat, Collaborative board)
4. **Advanced RxJS** (Autocomplete, Data table)
5. **Architecture skills** (Micro-frontend or Component library)
6. **Custom controls** (Date picker, Rich text editor)
7. **Modern features** (PWA or SSR implementation)

For interviews, have **2-3 projects** that you can discuss in depth, explaining:
- Architecture decisions
- Performance optimizations
- Challenges faced
- Trade-offs made
- Testing strategies
- What you'd do differently

Deploy them to GitHub Pages/Netlify with clean README files demonstrating your documentation skills. This shows you're not just a coder but a complete engineer.
